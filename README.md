# PORTFOLIO--HTML-CSS-JS

This is my Portfolio website which I have created using HTML,CSS & JavaScript.

It provides different webpages for all important details. 
We can open any specific webpage from the home (Main) screen's header.

You can open different links by clicking on the buttons ,images and text's to see important documents like :
Resume, Certificates, Projects , Results.
